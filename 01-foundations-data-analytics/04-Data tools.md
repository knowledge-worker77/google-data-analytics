## Spreadsheets
Spreadsheets are the most commonly used tool when it comes to anything that is related to data. The most commonly used spreadsheet software is Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets.

A spreadsheet is made up of rows and columns which make individual cells in the spreadsheet and the cells are where we input our data. The columns are organized by letters and the rows are organized by numbers.

Spreadsheets allows you to manipulate data in more ways than you can imagine, you do simple operations using built in methods or you can create complex custom functions based on your use case.

## SQL
The structured query language or SQL, sometimes pronounced as sequel is the primary language used to interact with relational databases such as MySQL and PostgresSQL.

Relational databases are somewhat similar to spreadsheets as they store data in the same way as a spreadsheet with some differences. A relational database has multiple tables and each table stores information in rows and columns much like a spreadsheet and you can even create relationships between the different tables in a database that's why they are called relational databases.

SQL works by using queries and the queries are your commands that you tell the database to do. If you want to retrieve some data you'll use a query that returns the required data to you. All operations like add, delete, and even updating data happens through queries in SQL.

```sql
SELECT first_name FROM customer_data.customer_details
WHERE first_name = "Bob"
```

> SQL queries can be as simple as the one above or as complex as you want them to be.

## Data visualization
Data visualization is another important skill and it allows data analyst to become story tellers and let their data tell stories of the past or future. The most commonly used data visualization software is called Tableau.

Data visuals helps to make sure your reports and findings are understood by other members especially the board of members and other stakeholders.
