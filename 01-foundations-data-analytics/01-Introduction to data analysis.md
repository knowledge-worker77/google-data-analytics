## Data is present everywhere
Data is present everywhere, you can extract data from even your everyday routine to see better insights about your life. There is so much data in our world that sometimes we might face and overload of information.

New data is being created around us every second and data in its rawest form isn't useful to us but if we collect and analyze data, find patterns and meanings in it then it is more valuable then oil in our modern day and age.

Data analysis is the process of making use of our data, that can even lead businesses in the correct direction based on how and what their users need.

There are six steps in the process of data analysis that include ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act. following these steps in order can improve problems that people might not be able to see.

## Data ecosystem
An ecosystem is a large area where similar group of elements interact together. The data ecosystem consists of both hardware and software that makes manipulating data easier for us, people store millions of gigabytes of data on cloud storage platforms and it plays a big role in the data ecosystem.

Companies store their data on clouds and you as a data analyst will need to use that for making better insights and guiding your team to make the right decisions.

## Data driven decisions
You can use decisions based on the insights that you have gained from your data. And this will help you make better decisions because you're following on what is the best thing right now based on facts and figures.

Sometimes people also have a feeling that what they're doing could go wrong and this is called a gut instinct. This can be a problem in most cases because there is no support material or logic for gut instinct, you're just feeling it.

Data isn't the only thing that a data analyst will need, you would also need to learn more about the business and the company's business model to gain more business insights from your data.

## Origins of the data analysis process
The roots of data analysis go far in time as when the Egyptians started to use statistics to help them build the pyramids more easily. The Egyptians were great when it came to organizing and documenting data, they documented all of their data and calculation theories.

The data analysis life cycle is the process of going from data to decision and the data that we use in this process has to go through several phases before we can use it to make meaningful decisions. But there are many process that differentiate from one another but mostly are the same.

The simplest process is: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act. And there other more complex processes of analyzing data.

The EMC corporation which is now been acquired by Dell was created by David Dietrich and it reflects the natural cycle of the real world, it has the following six steps: Discovery, Pre-processing, Model planning, Model building, Communication, Operationalize.

A leading data analytics company called SAS has created their own process for analyzing data that involves the following steps: Ask, Prepare, Explore, Model, Implement, Act, and Evaluate.

You can also use the project based life cycle for analyzing data on a per-project basis. This process contains the following steps: Identify, Design, Pre-processing, Data analysis, Visualization. This was created by Vignesh Prajapati it doesn't include the sixth phase but covers a lot of the same things as other processes do.

The big data analytics life cycle was created by Thomas Erl, Wajid Khattak, and Paul Buhler. This process includes the following steps: Case evaluation, Identify, Gathering and filtering, Extraction, Validation and cleaning, Representation, Analysis, Visualization, and Utilization.
